# openfx-text

Advanced internationalized cross-platform [OpenFX](http://openeffects.org/) text generator for Natron, Nuke, Resolve, Fusion and Vegas.

This project is a continuation of the Text node in Natron (from [openfx-arena](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/openfx-arena)), but with focus on cross-application support, better maintainability and more experimental features.

# Project moved to https://text.openfx.no
